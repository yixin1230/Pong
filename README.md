## About
Pong, often recognized as one of the pioneering computer games, is a classic "tennis-like" game featuring two paddles and a ball. The objective is simple yet engaging: players control the paddles to hit the ball back and forth across the screen.

I have implemented this iconic game in Java as a means to practice and refine my Java programming skills. This project not only served as an excellent exercise in object-oriented programming and graphical user interface (GUI) design but also allowed me to explore event-driven programming in Java.
